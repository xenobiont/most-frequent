# Task

Write the function mostFrequent, that will take an array and return the most common element in Array.
Functio should print a message into console: `most frequent element is: < >, which occures <> times`
Mind that array can have value of any types, including objects.

Objects should be compared by reference (i.e. different objects with the sae shape can be considered different)

if you have several elements with the same frequency, just log the latest one.

## Hint

use Map

# Advanced

if you have several elements with the same frequency, modify your log to describe that fact
